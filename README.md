### **📌 Student Performance Prediction**  
**Machine Learning | Linear Regression**  

🚀 **Predict student performance based on study hours using Machine Learning!**  

---

## **📖 Project Overview**  
This project applies **Linear Regression** to predict student performance based on various factors such as study hours. The dataset contains student scores, and the model is trained to forecast future performance trends.  

---

## **📊 Dataset**  
The dataset (`Marks.xlsx`) contains:  
- **Hours Studied** – Number of hours a student studies per day.  
- **Previous Scores** – Scores obtained in previous exams.
- **Attendance** - Percentage of attendance for class.
- **Final Score** – Target variable (score in the final exam).

## **🧑‍💻 Technologies Used**  
- **Python** 🐍  
- **Pandas & NumPy** 📊  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** 📈  
- **Scikit-Learn** 🤖  

---

## **📈 Model Performance**  
- **Algorithm**: Linear Regression  
- **Evaluation Metrics**:  
  - R² Score  
  - Mean Squared Error (MSE)  
  - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
